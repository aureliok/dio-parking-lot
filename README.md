# Project for DIO's bootcamp on .NET
## Parking Lot System

This repo is used to store the code used to complete the project lab's of dio's course on .net development.
The main goal was to build a console app with C# where one would implement 3 features for a simple parking lot system: add vehicles, remove vehicles and list all vehicles.

I've decided to go a little further and design a backend application using ASPNET Core Web API, and a frontend application using React and Typescript (a real simple one, as it's not my focus).

So the repo has codes for api routing, entities definition with usage of postgresql as the database, and several scripts to create data models to communicate with the frontend more easily.
As of additional features that I've implemented:
    <ul>
    <li>Registration of parking lots, clients, vehicles, and activities</li>
    <li>Update methods to change data on database</li>
    <li>Removal methods to delete data from database</li>
    <li>Methods to list vehicles on parking lots, clients or to just check all the activities done in a parking lot</li>
    </ul>
